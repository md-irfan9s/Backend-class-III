# ðŸš€ Learning Through Debugging: My Experience with Express.js Middleware ðŸ’¡

# what is MiddleWare 
Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), <br>
and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next function is a function in the Express router which, <br>
when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.
