# ðŸš€ My Experience with Express.js Middleware ðŸ’¡

 Today, I dove into building a basic Express.js server and got a hands-on refresher on middleware
# what is MiddleWare 
Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), <br>
and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next function is a function in the Express router which, <br>
when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.

# Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

Execute any code. <br>
Make changes to the request and the response objects. <br>
End the request-response cycle. <br>
Call the next middleware in the stack. <br>

# I have learned how to create a middleware and load into a application <br>
